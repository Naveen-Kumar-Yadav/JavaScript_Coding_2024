1. Always add **afterEach(cleanup)** unless you set the script to run automatically
   Failing to call cleanup when you've called render could result in a memory leak and tests which are not "idempotent" (which can lead to difficult to debug errors in your tests).

2. Avoid deep nesting
   I am sure you have seen code like this in tests files quite often. Itâ€™s so painful to maintain tests like these as its hard to keep track of what's initialized in before sections and what is state of data when actual scenario gets exected.

```js

describe('scenario 1 ', ()=>{
  before(()=>{
    ...
  });
  after(()=>{
    ...
  });
  describe('sub scenario', ()=>{
    before(()=>{
      ...
    });
    after(()=>{
      ...
    });
    describe('deep sub scenario', ()=>{
      ....
    });
  });
});

```

The best way is to avoid this nesting and try to isolate these scenarios which makes it really clean

```js
describe('scenario 1', ()=>{
  before(()=>{...})
  after(()=>{...})
  it('test scenario', ()=>{})
})

describe('scenario n', ()=>{
  before(()=>{...})
  after(()=>{...})
  it('test scenario', ()=>{})
}
```

So the above is an application of [Scoping](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/setup-teardown.html#scoping)

Meaning, by default, the before and after blocks apply to every test in a file. You can also group tests together using a describe block. When they are inside a describe block, the before and after blocks only apply to the tests within that describe block.

For example, let's say we had not just a city database, but also a food database. We could do different setup for different tests:

```js
// Applies to all tests in this file
beforeEach(() => {
  return initializeCityDatabase()
})

test("city database has Vienna", () => {
  expect(isCity("Vienna")).toBeTruthy()
})

test("city database has San Juan", () => {
  expect(isCity("San Juan")).toBeTruthy()
})

describe("matching cities to foods", () => {
  // Applies only to tests in this describe block
  beforeEach(() => {
    return initializeFoodDatabase()
  })

  test("Vienna <3 sausage", () => {
    expect(isValidCityFoodPair("Vienna", "Wiener Schnitzel")).toBe(true)
  })

  test("San Juan <3 plantains", () => {
    expect(isValidCityFoodPair("San Juan", "Mofongo")).toBe(true)
  })
})
```
