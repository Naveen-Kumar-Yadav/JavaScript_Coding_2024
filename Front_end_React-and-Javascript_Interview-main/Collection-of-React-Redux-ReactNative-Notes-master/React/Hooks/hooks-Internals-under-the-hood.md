#### [How does React implement hooks so that they rely on call order](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54673188/how-does-react-implement-hooks-so-that-they-rely-on-call-order)

**Behind the scenes, Hooks are represented as nodes which are linked together in their calling order. They internally are implemented as a queue with each hook being represented by a node having the reference to the next one.**

The schema of a single hook node can be viewed in the [implementation](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/5f06576f51ece88d846d01abd2ddd575827c6127/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L243). You‚Äôll see that the hook has some additional properties, but the key for understanding how hooks work lies within memoizedState and next. The rest of the properties are used specifically by the useReducer() hook to cache dispatched actions and base states so the reduction process can be repeated as a fallback in various cases:
baseState - The state object that would be given to the reducer.
baseUpdate - The most recent dispatched action that created the baseState.
queue - A queue of dispatched actions, waiting to go through the reducer.

From the documentation:

There is an internal list of ‚Äúmemory cells‚Äù associated with each component. They‚Äôre just JavaScript objects where we can put some data. When you call a Hook like useState(), it reads the current cell (or initializes it during the first render), and then moves the pointer to the next one. This is how multiple useState() calls each get independent local state.

[Offical Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#explanation)

As we learned earlier, we can use multiple State or Effect Hooks in a single component:

```js
function Form() {
  // 1. Use the name state variable
  const [name, setName] = useState("Mary")

  // 2. Use an effect for persisting the form
  useEffect(function persistForm() {
    localStorage.setItem("formData", name)
  })

  // 3. Use the surname state variable
  const [surname, setSurname] = useState("Poppins")

  // 4. Use an effect for updating the title
  useEffect(function updateTitle() {
    document.title = name + " " + surname
  })

  // ...
}
```

So how does React know which state corresponds to which useState call? The answer is that React relies on the order in which Hooks are called. Our example above works because the order of the Hook calls is the same on every render:

As long as the order of the Hook calls is the same between renders, React can associate some local state with each of them. But what happens if we put a Hook call (for example, the persistForm effect) inside a condition?

```js
// üî¥ We're breaking the first rule by using a Hook in a condition
if (name !== "") {
  useEffect(function persistForm() {
    localStorage.setItem("formData", name)
  })
}
```

The name !== '' condition is true on the first render, so we run this Hook. However, on the next render the user might clear the form, making the condition false. Now that we skip this Hook during rendering, the order of the Hook calls becomes different:

```js
useState("Mary") // 1. Read the name state variable (argument is ignored)
// useEffect(persistForm)  // üî¥ This Hook was skipped!
useState("Poppins") // üî¥ 2 (but was 3). Fail to read the surname state variable
useEffect(updateTitle) // üî¥ 3 (but was 4). Fail to replace the effect
```

React wouldn‚Äôt know what to return for the second useState Hook call. React expected that the second Hook call in this component corresponds to the persistForm effect, just like during the previous render, but it doesn‚Äôt anymore. From that point, every next Hook call after the one we skipped would also shift by one, leading to bugs.

This is why Hooks must be called on the top level of our components. If we want to run an effect conditionally, we can put that condition inside our Hook:

```js
useEffect(function persistForm() {
  // üëç We're not breaking the first rule anymore
  if (name !== "") {
    localStorage.setItem("formData", name)
  }
})
```
